# Building and training a regression model for a bike sharing company

The goal of this project was to build and train a regression model on the Captial Bike Share Kaggle data set. First, I split the data into train and test. Then I conducted an exploratory data analysis. Did some feature engineering and trained several regession models (linear, poisson, ridge, and lasso).
